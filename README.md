## The idea

Have a small business who want or need an ERP but have no internet access or can't afford to pay a susbcrition to a cloud hosted service? This solution is for you.
You can either find someone to run this on Raspberry Pi and help you configure your Android phone to work with it or DIY.

This is MobilERP-android. Check the companion repo MobilERP-server [MobilERP-server](https://github.com/eligiobz/mobilerp-server)
